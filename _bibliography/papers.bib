  abstract={Testing capacity for COVID-19 remains a challenge globally due to the lack of adequate supplies, trained personnel, and sample-processing equipment. These problems are even more acute in rural and underdeveloped regions. We demonstrate that solicited-cough sounds collected over a phone, when analysed by our AI model, have statistically significant signal indicative of COVID-19 status (AUC 0.72, t-test, p < 0.01, 95% CI 0.61—0.83). This holds true for asymptomatic patients as well. Towards this, we collect the largest known (to date) dataset of microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 cough sounds from 3,621 individuals. When used in a triaging step within an overall testing protocol, by enabling risk-stratification of individuals before confirmatory tests, our tool can increase the testing capacity of a healthcare system by 43% at disease prevalence of 5%, without additional supplies, trained personnel, or physical infrastructure.},

  title={Data-Sharing Economy: Value-Addition from Data meets Privacy},
  author={Piyush Bagad and Subrata Mitra and Sunny Dhamnani and Atanu R Sinha and Haresh Khanna and Raunak Gautam},
  abstract={The need for improved segmentation, targeting, personalization fuel the practice of data sharing among companies. Concurrently, data sharing faces the headwind of new laws emphasizing users’ privacy in data. Under the premise that sharing of data occurs from a provider to a recipient, we propose a practicable approach of generating representational data for sharing that achieves valueaddition for the recipient’s tasks, while preserving privacy of users. Prior art shows that the mechanism to improve value-addition inevitably weakens privacy in the generated data. In a first of a kind contribution, our system offers tunable controls to adjust the extent of privacy desired by the provider and the extent of valueaddition expected by the recipient. Our experiments on a public data show that under common organizational practice of data-sharing, data generation for value-addition is achievable while preserving privacy. Our demonstration starkly shows the trade-off between privacy-protection and value addition, through user controlled knobs and offers a prototype of a platform for data sharing which is mindful of this trade-off.},
