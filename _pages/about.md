Hi! I will be starting my Master's in AI at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). 
I am passionate about research and have developed interest in a variety of areas: video understanding, 3D vision, probabilistic modelling & inference. I also have newly-found curiosity in geometric deep learning, deep generative models and so many other exciting areas in machine learning that evolve each day.

In the past, I've been a Research Fellow at [Wadhwani AI](http://wadhwaniai.org){:target="\_blank"}. Here, I primarily worked on [estimating infant anthropometry from a monocular video](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/). During the pandemic, I also worked on [using cough as a biomarker to detect presence of CoVID-19](https://coughagainstcovid.org/).

Before that, I completed my Bachelor's in Mathematics at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where I enjoyed my coursework, especially courses on probabilistic modelling taught by [Dr. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). During this time, I worked on a variety of mini-projects on a variety of topics: Bayesian optimization, zero-shot learning and understanding rotations in 3D.

During my undergrad, I was fortunate to have been a Research Intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) where I worked on privacy and bias in ML models.
