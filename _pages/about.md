Hi! I am a Research Fellow at [Wadhwani AI](http://wadhwaniai.org){:target="\_blank"}. I am passionate about research and broadly interested in 3D computer vision, probabilistic modelling and inference.

At [Wadhwani AI](http://wadhwaniai.org){:target="\_blank"}, I have been primarily working on [estimating infant anthropometry from a monocular video](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/). Since the advent of the pandemic, I have also been working on the [Cough Against COVID](https://coughagainstcovid.org/) initiative.

In the past, I have been a Research Intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) where I worked on privacy and bias in ML models. 

I completed my Bachelor's in Mathematics at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where I enjoyed my coursework, especially courses on probabilistic modelling taught by [Dr. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). During this time, I worked on a variety of mini-projects on a variety of topics: Bayesian optimization, zero-shot learning and understanding rotations in 3D.
